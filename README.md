Create polished app icons from a source image on macOS or Windows. Icon
Creator produces matching macOS `.icns`, Windows `.ico`, and PNG files with
live rounded-corner preview, zoom and exact-fit scaling, drag-to-recenter
positioning, optional solid-background transparency, and automatic cleanup of
temporary working files.

## Install

1. Download the macOS DMG or Windows executable from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Photon-Security/icon-creator/releases/latest).
2. On macOS, open the DMG and drag **Icon Creator.app** into `/Applications`. On Windows, run the downloaded executable.
3. Launch the app and drop in a PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, SVG, ICO, or ICNS source image.

### First launch: allow the app

The app is ad-hoc signed but not notarized with Apple, so macOS may block it the
first time. If that happens, click **Cancel**, then open **System Settings ->
Privacy & Security** and choose **Open Anyway** for Icon Creator.

If you prefer Terminal:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Icon Creator.app"
```

## Use

Drop an image onto the preview area or click **Browse**. Use **Shape feel** to
control the rounded corners, **Zoom** to fit the full source or crop tighter,
and drag the preview to center the source image. Click **Create icons** to export matching `.icns`
`.ico`, and `.png` files beside the selected base output path.

Enable **Transparent outer color** when the source image has a solid white,
off-white, or otherwise flat background connected to the outer edge. Icon
Creator turns that connected outer color into alpha before applying the rounded
corner mask.

The normal app flow leaves only the finished `.icns`, `.ico`, and `.png` files.
Temporary `icon.png` and `.iconset` files are generated in a temp directory and
removed automatically unless **Keep working files** is enabled.

For a non-square source, the Zoom control can move below 100% down to the exact
fit needed to show the complete image. Any exposed square canvas remains
transparent, while 100% retains the familiar center-filled crop.

When reopening an existing `.ico` or `.icns`, Icon Creator selects its largest
supported frame and defaults the export name to `<name>-edited`, protecting the
original file. PNG- and BMP-backed ICO frames and modern ICNS image entries are
supported; legacy JPEG2000-only ICNS files are reported as unsupported.

## Features

- Native macOS and Windows desktop apps built with Go, Wails, and React
- Drag-and-drop source image selection
- PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, SVG, ICO, and ICNS input support
- Live rounded-corner overlay preview
- Exact-fit zoom-out, tighter crop, and drag-to-recenter controls
- Automatic `.icns`, `.ico`, and PNG export
- Optional connected solid-background removal to alpha
- Cleanup by default, with optional working-file retention
- CLI support for scripted icon generation

## Build

Requirements:

- macOS or Windows
- Go 1.22 or newer
- Node.js and npm
- Wails v2 installed at `$HOME/go/bin/wails`, or set `WAILS_BIN`

Build the app for the current platform:

```bash
./scripts/build_macos.sh
```

```powershell
.\scripts\build_windows.ps1
```

The packaged DMG is written to:

```text
dist/Icon-Creator-1.3.9-macOS-arm64.dmg
dist/Icon-Creator-1.3.9-Windows-amd64.exe
```

## CLI Usage

```bash
go run ./cmd/icon-creator -input Icon.png -output app.icns -radius 220 -zoom 1.4 -pan-x 20 -pan-y -10
```

Use `-keep-intermediates` when you need the generated `icon.png` and `.iconset`
folder for inspection.

Use `-transparent-background` to turn a solid connected outer color into alpha.

`-pan-x` and `-pan-y` accept values from `-100` to `100` and are useful after
zooming in to recenter the source image.

`-zoom 1.0` fills the square. Non-square sources also accept smaller positive
values down to their exact-fit ratio; lower values are clamped to exact fit.
